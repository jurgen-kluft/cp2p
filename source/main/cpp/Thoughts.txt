

P2P NODE
- Zer0 copy messaging (send and receive)
- Event loop (no threading)
- Peer object based connection, identified using endpoint

UDX
- Packet allocation is done through an allocator that actually allocates a udx_packet so
  that when it is given back to the layer above as a user message we don't need to extra
  allocate any info, book-keeping and header data for this message.

PoCC (Performance Oriented Congestion Control)

MI - Monitor Interval
U  - Utility (the value indicating performance = Throughput - Loss)

Why do we need to include timing fields in the to-send packet?s
RTT can be computed from remembering when a packet was send and when we received
an ACK for this packet.
The only info in a packet is
- flags(1)
- connection-id(2)  ? Do we need this
- sequence-nr(2)
- ACK(5)
- receiver-delay-us(2)  ! The delay at the receiver side before sending back ACKs



(A) - packet 1:1 --> send --> wire --> receive --> packet 1 - (B)

(A) remember 1:1 and the time it was sent
(B) remember 1:1 and the time it was received
    when sending back an ACK we can figure out how much time was spend before it was
	send back and include that as micro-seconds in the packet.

(A) receives back a packet that includes
